# Integrated_Circuits_Labs
Integrated Circuits &amp; Microelectronic Lab Sessions (Basys 3 FPGA, Vivado Tools, VHDL).

Building and verifying a waveform generator (ROM-based sine + timing control), interfacing an 8-bit DAC via PMOD, developing testbenches and simulations, and delivering synthesizable, pin-mapped designs for on-board validation with measurements.
